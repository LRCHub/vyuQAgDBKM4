My memories of you
Luncheon leblanc speaking of the amazon
Or navigating through
Your hometown ipanema

Walking on the beach
Holding a shoes you describe just how amused
Surrender to Newark
In one piece no problema

My memories of you
Always derives from my heart up to my eyes
On question that be blue
Intervals of the mem'ries

And now that goes to in the movie
Shadow for you with the seat
Enters again why do we flow like water for a while only to disappear like wind

My memories of you
Here in new york we had your piano port
In terms of dreams come true
For me the combination
When I replay those tapes
Here in Newark i'm inside the photograph
The songs we wrote the tune
Like one mock conversation

My memories of you
Always derives from my heart up to my eyes
