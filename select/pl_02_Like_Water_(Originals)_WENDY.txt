Sometimes we're doing good
Sometimes it feels so bad
Sometimes we give up the fight
Sometimes
we can't see the light, right
You know how lovers flow
You know how lovers grow
Sometimes we gotta explode
Come on baby,
you know how love goes
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We are like water, like water
Made to survive
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We're part of each other,
like water
You're giving me life
You know I got you, babe
Even on cloudy days
Into the rain, I may cry
Still you're the love of
my life, babe
I'll take you anywhere
Just say it, I'll take you there
Out to the moon and the sea
Babe, I'm your galaxy
Come to me
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We are like water, like water
Made to survive
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We're part of each other,
like water
You're giving me life
Oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We're part of each other,
like water
Made to survive
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We're part of each other,
like water
You're giving me life
