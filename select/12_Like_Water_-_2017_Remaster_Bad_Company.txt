My life is like water
And I'm floating in the sea
But I have a root in the water
And it's reaching, stretching endlessly

My love, flying in the sky
And far away from the water she lies
Sometimes big wave

Coming when I'm down
But soon I stand on up again

{2x}
My life is like water
And I'm floating in the sea
My soul is a stream on the water
I was born reaching endlessly
