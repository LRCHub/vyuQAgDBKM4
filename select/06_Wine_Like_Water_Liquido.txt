It happens all to fast, remember back, than thinking 'bout it all
A breeze of dusty air, my mouth is dry and i'm careful... stomach hurts
I guess that i will stand it, but not knowing the sense of it all
And i'm walking by the water, throwing bottles into wild waves
So you can catch them, s.o.s. i'm waiting for you to save me...
Refrain:
...and i feel... bored and broken, truth burns while i'm waiting
Watching wild wild waves again
I finally drank wine like water, truth burns while i'm waiting
Watching wild wild waves again
It's like stop and go, completly shocked and i'm bleeding, once again
Things getting out of hand, i feel like pushed to the limit
Did you know that my heart is pumping harder than ever before
And i'm walking by the water, throwing bottles into wild waves
So you can catch them, s.o.s. i'm waiting for you to save me...
Refrain:...and i feel...
Always pointing to the sky and thinking 'bout the same things
And if i could i wouldn't tell the stars
The truth it burns so deep inside i know i've done it all wrong
I should have been there for you
Refrain:...and i feel...
