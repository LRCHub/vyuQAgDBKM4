Holy Spirit, would You pour
Your fire out like water?
Like water
Lord, we need Your presence
more than our bodies need water
Need water
When I'm stuck in the desert
(Wow)
Suffocating from dry thirst
(Hey, hey)
In my moment of need,
I fall to my knees
and cry out to Jesus
The only way, I know, works
Holy Spirit, would You pour
Your fire out like water? (Hey)
Like water (Hey)
Lord, we need Your presence
more than our bodies need water
(Hey)
Need water (Hey)
Holy Father, oh, I need Ya
I am yearning for Your water
You are my Pharaoh, my Daddy
You are the only Pharaoh for me
Yes, I was blind,
but now I see Ya
I run away,
but now I'm eager, uh
I treat my needs like a Visa
When I want access,
the giver offering fiber
'Cause when I couldn't walk
on water
I cried unto my Father
What a sudden relief
You come through for me
My longing is please
Holy Spirit, would You pour
Your fire out like water?
(I can feel it like water)
Like water
(I can feel it like water)
Lord, we need Your presence
more than our bodies need water
(We need water)
Need water
(Yes, we need water)
You never leave nor forsake me
All of my tests...
Only You can satisfy me
Rain down water
Rain down fire, fire, fire,
fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
