Like water, shapeless, swimming through waves
目を閉じ endless, どこにでもいける
We'd be diving anywhere we go yeah
Let go let go 溺れないように
You know you know there's no gravity
Feels like I'm floating in space with you
Ooh I get the feels when I'm diving with you
Because I like you
Ooh, いつでも I am diving with you
No matter how deep, it's alright
留まりたくない感情
I can be whatever you want
何色にでもなれる Oh
Wash it away anytime
Let go let go 溺れないように
You know you know there's no gravity
Feels like I'm floating in space with you
Ooh I get the feels when I'm diving with you
Because I like you
Ooh, いつでも I am diving with you
No matter how deep, it's alright
Diving with you Diving with you
Diving with you Diving with you
Ooh I get the feels when I'm diving with you
Because I like you
Ooh, いつでも I am diving with you
No matter how deep, it's alright
Diving with you Diving with you
Diving with you Diving with you
I just wanna sink and feel your love love
沈んでく 君という海
